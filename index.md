### NFL Analytics Pipeline with ETL & Interactive Dashboard

This project is an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests NFL game data from ESPN's API, processes 815+ games across three seasons through an ETL pipeline, and stores the data in a DuckDB analytics database using a star schema design. When the standings API failed, I calculated standings directly from raw game results, demonstrating problem-solving and data engineering fundamentals. The pipeline includes comprehensive data quality validation and delivers insights through an interactive Streamlit dashboard with team performance analytics, player statistics, and playoff brackets. This showcases my skills in API integration, ETL development, SQL database design, data transformation with Python/Pandas, and building production-ready data pipelines with proper error handling and documentation.

### Customer Churn Modelling

This end to end customer churn prediction project analyzes 7,043 telecommunications customers using SQL for data extraction, Python for advanced feature engineering (creating 8 domain-informed features), and machine learning to build a production ready XGBoost classifier achieving 70%+ ROC-AUC score. The project demonstrates systematic model comparison across 5 algorithms, hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV, and proper handling of class imbalance through weighted training and stratified sampling. Results translate to actionable business insights with ROI analysis, identifying tenure and contract type as primary churn drivers and recommending targeted retention strategies for high-risk customer segments.

### Marketing Analysis - Portuguese Bank Data

This project is about approaching a typical problem I would encounter in the working world. The aim is to acurately predict whether a customer will sign up to a long term deposit or not. It is also a perfect dataset to practise using various dataset balancing methods. The data is freely available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing.

### Detecting False Correlations in Time Series Data

Time Series Data makes up more than 75% of the data the general public consumes on a daily basis. This project, the Dissertation I submitted for my Masters Degree, firstly aims to determine whether time series data contains correlations by default, and then attempts to find a way of detecting false correlations in Time Series Data.

### Baseball Hitting Classifications

This project was more of a passion project for me. Using a K-nearest neighbours algorithm on Sean Lahman's free baseball database, available at http://seanlahman.com/download-baseball-database/, I built a model that takes a players slash line (batting statistics) and outputs a ranking and a few players from history with similar statistics over one season. This can be used to evaluate players performance at the plate over a series, month or whole season and give context on how good or bad their performance has been.

### UK Covid Data Analysis

Using the data freely avaiable at [https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/details/download](https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/covid-19-archive-data-download), I explore a number of different relationships between variables. In this project, I delved into UK COVID-19 data to uncover the reasons behind variations in infection rates across different regions. By combining demographic data, vaccination rates, and socioeconomic factors, I aimed to gain valuable insights that could guide targeted public health measures and resource allocation strategies.
